# Audio-Video Processor

The Audio-Video Processor is a Python-based tool designed to automate the processing of audio and video files. It splits audio files into chunks based on silence detection, pairs each audio chunk with a video clip of matching or exceeding length, resizes the video to a specific format, replaces the video's original audio with the audio chunk, and finally concatenates all processed clips into a single video file. This tool is especially useful for creating content optimized for social media platforms that favor vertical video formats, such as Instagram Stories or TikTok.

## Features

- **Audio Splitting:** Automatically splits audio files into segments based on periods of silence.
- **Video Matching:** Finds and selects video clips based on the length requirement of each audio segment.
- **Audio Replacement:** Integrates audio segments into selected video clips, replacing the original audio.
- **Video Resizing:** Standardizes video clips to a vertical format (1080x1920 resolution) for compatibility with various social media platforms.
- **Concatenation:** Merges all processed video clips into a single, cohesive final video.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- FFmpeg (required for handling video and audio processing)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the Audio-Video Processor, follow these steps:

Prepare your media files:

Place your .mp3 audio files in the designated directory.
Store your .mp4 video files in the videos/hooks and videos/viral directories as specified in the script.
Run the script:
Navigate to the project directory and execute the script by running:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
When prompted, enter the path to your audio file.

View the output:
The script will process the files and output a final video in the specified output directory, named according to the original audio file and the current date and time.

Customization
You can customize the script to suit your needs by modifying the following parameters in the process_audio_and_video function:

audio_output_dir: The directory where processed videos and the final concatenated video will be saved.
initial_video_search_dir and subsequent_video_search_dir: Directories where initial and subsequent video clips are stored.
target_resolution: The resolution to which all video clips will be resized.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Verify that FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
Ensure that the specified directories for audio and video files exist and contain the correct file types.
Check the console output for any error messages that can help identify the problem.
